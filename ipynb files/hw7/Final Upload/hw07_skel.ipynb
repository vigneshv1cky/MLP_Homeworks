    "## Homework 07: Model Comparisons\n",
    " \n",
    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "Read through the entire notebook and do not write any code. This assignment\n",
    "is more complex than previous ones, and it will be helpful to have a sense of \n",
    "the structure before you start coding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be comparing different models after performing holistic cross validation to find the best parameter sets for various sizes of the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will be experimenting with 3 different model types:\n",
    "1. LinearRegression (this is just a 2D experiment since there are no hyperparameters)\n",
    "2. Ridge\n",
    "3. Lasso\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a hyper-parameter set is chosen for these models, we will compare the test set performance across each pair of models.  Remember -- you should only look at test set performance late in any evaluation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data set\n",
    "The dataset is identical to what we used in HW06\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "* Use and understand __Holistic Cross Validation__\n",
    "* Understand how training set size affects model choices\n",
    "* Learn to perform model selection using hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "* All Homework must be individual work.  Do not look at or copy solutions of other students or that are available on the Internet or via LLMs\n",
    "* Only work in a copy of the file that is from your ~/homework_in/ directory\n",
    "   + If you do not use your own copy of this file, then it is an automatic zero on the assignment\n",
    "* Read the code below \n",
    "* For any cell that is flagged as *TODO*, complete the code according to the specifications\n",
    "* Execute each cell and verify that it is showing correct results.  Note that because we are reusing variables, the order of execution is *really* important (you should code assuming top to bottom execution).\n",
    "* All the plotting functions have been provided. You should not need to alter any of these.\n",
    "* Hand-In Procedure\n",
    "  + Make sure that your notebook has been saved.  You are responsible for ensuring that the copy that you submit is current and complete\n",
    "  + The name of the file should be the same as what we gave you\n",
    "  + Download this file to your local machine (extension: .ipynb)\n",
    "  + Submit to the Gradescope Notebook HW07 dropbox\n",
